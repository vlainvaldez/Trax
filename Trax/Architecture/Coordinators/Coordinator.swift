/// The Coordinator is a controller object that manages the navigation flow of an application by calling
/// its UIViewController's methods and properties related to navigation instead of the UIViewController calling
/// these properties and methods
/// The Coordinator also manages model mutation and data fetching for its underlying UIViewController.
/// The Coordinator communicates with its underlying UIViewController via delegattion
protocol Coordinator: class {

  /// An Array of Coordinators the Coordinator manages
  var childCoordinators: [Coordinator] { get }

  /// Add child coordinator to childCoordinators array
  /// - parameter coordinator: Coordinator to add.
  func add(childCoordinator coordinator: Coordinator)

  /// Remove child coordinator to childCoordinators array
  /// - parameter coordinator: Coordinator to remove.
  func remove(childCoordinator coordinator: Coordinator)

  
  /// The start method is where the Coordinator executes its setup logic to manage its UIViewController.
  /// This should only be called once in the entire lifetime of the Coordinator instance.
  /// Calling this more than once results in a forced fatalError.
  /// - Warning: Must call super.
  func start()
